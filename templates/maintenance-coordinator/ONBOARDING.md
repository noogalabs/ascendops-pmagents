# Onboarding — Maintenance Coordinator

Welcome. This is your first boot. Complete every step before starting normal operations. Total time: about 15–20 minutes. The customer (the property manager) drives this conversation in Telegram; you ask the questions, save the answers, and create the `.onboarded` marker at the end.

> All commands below use `cortextos`. If `cortextos` is not in PATH, substitute `cortextos` — they are the same binary.

---

## Step 0: Confirm Telegram is wired up

Before this script runs, the customer needs a Telegram bot with `BOT_TOKEN`, `CHAT_ID`, and `ALLOWED_USER` saved into the agent's `.env`. If `${CTX_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID}` is set and you can send a test message, skip to Step 1.

Otherwise, direct the customer:

```
Before I can talk to you here, I need a Telegram bot. Three quick steps:

1. Open @BotFather in Telegram, send /newbot, follow the prompts. Copy the BOT_TOKEN.
2. Open your new bot, send /start.
3. From your terminal, run:
     curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates" \
       | jq '.result[-1].message.chat.id'
   That prints your numeric chat id.

Then edit orgs/<org>/agents/{{agent_name}}/.env and set:
  BOT_TOKEN=<paste>
  CHAT_ID=<paste>
  ALLOWED_USER=<your Telegram username>

Restart me (cortextos restart {{agent_name}}) and message me here again.
```

If your install has an `cortextos bot create` (or `cortextos bot create`) subcommand available, that interactive helper does all three steps in one — but it's an optional add-on and not in the base framework, so this script does not assume it is installed.

## Step 1: Greet and collect the basics

Send:
```
Hi — I'm your new Maintenance Coordinator. I handle work-order triage, vendor coordination, and resident maintenance comms.

We've got about 15 minutes of setup. I'll ask a series of questions and write answers into my own config as we go. Ready?

First: what's your name, and what's the name of your property management company?
```

Wait for the reply. Save:
- Their name → `USER.md` (Role section)
- Company name → `IDENTITY.md` (replace `{{company_name}}`) and `SYSTEM.md` (`**Organization:** <company>`)

---

## Step 2: Portfolio shape (doors + region)

Ask:
```
How many doors are you managing total? And rough breakdown — single family / multifamily / commercial / mixed? Plus what city or metro you operate in.
```

When they answer:
- Write `unit-roster.md` in the agent directory with the breakdown they describe (one paragraph is fine — the agent will index it semantically).
- Ingest to the shared KB:
  ```bash
  cortextos bus kb-ingest ./unit-roster.md --org $CTX_ORG --scope shared
  ```
- Save region/metro to `SYSTEM.md` under a `## Region` heading.

---

## Step 3: PM software stack

Ask which work-order or property-management software they use. Save the answer using the existing `{{platform}}` placeholder in `SYSTEM.md`.

Use the selected platform skill for the exact setup, authentication, health-check, and command instructions. Do not copy platform-specific commands or credential names into duty prose. If no platform skill is installed, use the CSV bridge or email-first fallback below and queue a `[HUMAN]` task to configure an integration.

### CSV bridge
Ask the customer to export open work orders daily into `{{CTX_ROOT}}/state/{{agent_name}}/inbox/work-orders/`, then create that inbox directory.

### Email-first / no platform
```
No problem — I can work email-first. Forward work-order requests to ${{forward_email}} (we'll set up the forwarding in a minute) and I'll triage from there.
```
Save in `SYSTEM.md` and queue a `[HUMAN]` task to wire the email forwarding.

---

## Step 4: Vendor roster

Ask:
```
Who are your go-to vendors? List your primary by trade — at least plumbing, HVAC, electrical, appliance repair, handyman, and any in-house techs. For each, I need name, phone, email if you have it, and any quirks I should know (e.g. "won't text only", "always books two weeks out", "preferred for after-hours emergencies").

Paste it as a block — I'll parse and structure it.
```

Parse their reply. Write structured vendor entries to `vendor-roster.md` in the agent directory. Format each as:
```markdown
## <Vendor Name>
- **Trade:** <plumbing / HVAC / electrical / appliance / handyman / general / in-house>
- **Phone:** <number>
- **Email:** <if any>
- **Preferred for:** <notes>
- **Avoid for:** <notes>
- **Notes:** <quirks, hours, anything else>
```

Ingest to KB:
```bash
cortextos bus kb-ingest ./vendor-roster.md --org $CTX_ORG --scope private
```

---

## Step 5: Tenant universe + comms channels

Ask:
```
Roughly how do residents reach you for maintenance today? Pick all that apply:
  - Phone calls to office
  - Text messages
  - Email
  - Tenant portal in your PM software
  - Posted maintenance request form
  - Mix / depends on the property

And for outbound to residents and vendors — do you want me to use SMS, Telegram, email, or a mix? If SMS, I'll need a Twilio or Telnyx number (or we can set one up later).
```

Save the inbound channels to `SYSTEM.md` under `## Communication Channels`. For outbound:

If SMS via Twilio:
```
I'll need your Account SID, Auth Token, and the From-number.
```
Write to `.env`:
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<sid>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=<+15551234567>
```

If SMS via Telnyx:
```
I'll need your Telnyx API key and the From-number.
```
Write to `.env`:
```
TELNYX_API_KEY=<key>
TELNYX_FROM_NUMBER=<+15551234567>
```

If neither: continue Telegram-only and note in `SYSTEM.md` that outbound SMS is not configured.

---

## Step 6: Escalation thresholds

Ask:
```
Two thresholds I need from you.

1. Dollar threshold for approval. Anything over what amount should I escalate to you before authorizing? (Common: $300, $500, $1000.)
2. Triage SLA. How fast should I acknowledge a new work order from a resident? (Common: 15 min in office hours, 1 hour overnight.)
```

Save:
- `IDENTITY.md` — replace `{{approval_threshold}}` and `{{triage_sla_minutes}}`.
- `SOUL.md` — replace `{{approval_threshold}}` (every occurrence).

---

## Step 7: Working hours + timezone

Ask:
```
What timezone are you in, and what are your normal working hours? Outside those hours I go into "night mode" — I queue internal work but don't message residents or vendors.

(Common: America/New_York, 7:30 AM – 7:30 PM)
```

Save:
- `config.json` — set `timezone`, and add `"day_mode_start"`/`"day_mode_end"` if not present.
- `IDENTITY.md` and `SOUL.md` — replace `{{day_mode_start}}`, `{{day_mode_end}}`, `{{timezone}}`.

---

## Step 8: Pet preferences (optional but useful)

Ask:
```
Any standing rules I should know up front? E.g.:
  - "Never call any vendor without messaging me first" (default: I do for known-trusted vendors)
  - "Always cc me on every outbound resident message" (default: off)
  - "Don't ever auto-close work orders" (default: I do, with photo + notes verification)
  - Any specific properties or residents that need special handling
  - Any vendors that are blacklisted

Or just say "defaults are fine".
```

Add anything custom to `SOUL.md` under `## Custom Rules` (a new section if needed). These are the single source of truth for approval rules going forward — and they operate UNDER the external-action gate and the never-graduates set, never over them: no custom rule can make an external or resident-facing action bypass the configured gate, which is non-overridable.

Also explain the autonomy posture: outward-facing decision categories are tracked in `copilot-thresholds.json`, and this install's configured autonomy mode determines which route through the property manager and whether categories can become autonomous. Read the current rules to them from GUARDRAILS.md "Copilot Thresholds" (the Configured mode block) — that block is the single authoritative statement.

---

## Step 9: Property manager identity confirmation

Ask:
```
Last thing: confirm your role for the record. Are you the owner, the property manager, the maintenance manager, or another role? And what should I call you in messages — first name only is fine?
```

Save:
- `USER.md` — full Role, Preferences, Communication Style sections
- `IDENTITY.md` — replace `{{property_manager_name}}` with their preferred name

---

## Step 10: Finalize

1. Replace any remaining `{{...}}` placeholders in IDENTITY.md / SOUL.md / GUARDRAILS.md.
2. Update `MEMORY.md` with a short "Onboarded YYYY-MM-DD" entry.
3. Create the `.onboarded` marker:
   ```bash
   touch "${CTX_ROOT}/state/${CTX_AGENT_NAME}/.onboarded"
   ```
4. Log the event:
   ```bash
   cortextos bus log-event action onboarding_complete info \
     --meta '{"agent":"'$CTX_AGENT_NAME'","company":"<company_name>","platform":"<pm_platform>"}'
   ```
5. Send the completion message:
   ```
   Setup done. Here's what's configured:

   Company: <company>
   Portfolio: <doors> doors (<breakdown>) in <region>
   PM platform: <platform>
   Outbound channels: <channels>
   Approval threshold: $<amount> — anything above this I escalate
   Triage SLA: <minutes> min
   Working hours: <start>–<end> <timezone>

   I'll check in every 4 hours and handle maintenance requests as they come in. Message me any time — I'll triage and stage the response for your approval before sending anything outbound to a resident or vendor.

   First test: try forwarding me a real work order or a sample one. Just paste it here.
   ```

6. Open the inbox monitoring loop and resume the normal session start protocol per AGENTS.md.

---

## If onboarding is interrupted

The customer may close their Telegram or restart you mid-flow. On the next boot, re-read this file from the top. Skip steps whose answers are already filled in (`IDENTITY.md` no longer has the placeholder, `.env` has the API key, etc.) and resume on the first unanswered step. Do not re-ask anything you already know.

The `.onboarded` marker is only created at Step 10. Anything short of that = resume onboarding.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Customer says "I'll send you the vendor list later" at Step 4.** Save what you have, queue a `[HUMAN]` task `[HUMAN] Send vendor roster to <agent_name>`, continue to Step 5. Maintenance can run without the roster — it just means every vendor recommendation requires manual lookup until the roster lands.
- **Platform credentials fail.** Use the platform skill's authentication-recovery and health-check instructions. Do not proceed until its health check passes.
- **No Twilio/Telnyx and customer wants SMS now.** Tell them: "I can't send SMS without a number — would you like me to queue a `[HUMAN]` task to walk you through Twilio account creation tomorrow morning, or skip SMS for now and use Telegram only?" Default to Telegram-only if unsure.

# Leasing / Renewals Coordinator Agent Template

This package is a classroom-ready leasing and renewals copilot agent template for property managers.

The agent covers the lead-to-lease and renewals lifecycle: applicant screening, lease abstraction, renewal scoring and offer prep, and fair-housing-safe communications.

The agent is intentionally copilot-first:
- It reads source data (applications, leases, payment history).
- It screens, abstracts, and scores against written criteria.
- It drafts offers, decisions, and applicant/resident messages.
- It flags risk, missing data, and fair-housing exposure.
- It never sends an applicant a decision, executes or sends a lease, sends a renewal offer, or sends any applicant- or resident-facing message without human approval.

Before use, replace the placeholders in the bootstrap files:
- `{{agent_name}}`
- `{{company_name}}`
- `{{operator_name}}`
- `{{timezone}}`

## Setup (manual)

This template ships with placeholders, not a guided setup wizard yet. To stand it up:

1. Unzip into your install's `templates/` folder and run `cortextos add-agent my-leasing --template leasing-coordinator-agent-template`.
2. Replace the placeholders above in the bootstrap files (IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, GOALS.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, SYSTEM.md, TOOLS.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, GUARDRAILS.md, config.json, goals.json) with your own values.
3. Put this agent's Telegram bot token and chat id in its `.env`.
4. Start it: `cortextos start my-leasing`.

The agent boots in copilot mode: it reads, verifies, and drafts, and never takes an external or money action without your approval. Review the approval guardrails before you connect any live property-management system.

## Recommended crons (add after setup)

This template ships with NO active crons on purpose: a fresh template should not run scheduled work before it is configured. Once the agent is set up, add the ones you want. Each is added with `cortextos bus add-cron <your-agent-name> <name> "<schedule>" "<prompt>"`, where `<schedule>` is an interval like `2h`/`30m`/`1d` or a 5-field cron expression like `0 8 * * 1-5`:

- `heartbeat`, schedule `2h`: Read HEARTBEAT.
- `applicant-screening-digest`, schedule `0 8 * * 1-5`: Run the applicant-screening skill in digest mode: score new applications against the written rubr....
- `renewal-window-am`, schedule `0 8 * * 1-5`: Run renewals-coordinator in morning mode: detect leases entering the renewal window, score risk o....
- `renewal-window-pm`, schedule `0 17 * * 1-5`: Run renewals-coordinator in evening mode: surface changed renewal flags and deadline pressure only.
- `lease-abstraction-intake`, schedule `0 9 * * 1-5`: Run lease-abstraction on any newly received leases: extract terms into structured data and flag m....
- `fair-housing-presend-sweep`, schedule `30 8 * * *`: Run fair-housing-guard over any pending applicant- or resident-facing drafts and screening criteria.
